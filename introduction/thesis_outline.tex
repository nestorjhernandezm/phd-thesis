\section{Thesis Outline}\label{sec:intro_thesis_outline}

Based on the concepts of cooperative \ac{D2D} communications with \ac{RLNC}, this thesis covers two outlines. First, it was considered a research line which main goal was to obtain network codes for cooperation in underlay \ac{D2D} cellular networks to enhance the throughput and reduce the energy consumption from the \ac{BS} and the mobile devices. Here, \ac{D2D} communications take place within the cellular spectrum between mobile devices in the same cell and the interference is prevented under proper network planning. Second, a research line to investigate the transmission policies for the devices in a decentralized multihop \ac{WLAN} was considered to enhance the previously mentioned metrics by reducing the required number of transmissions to decode a batch of packets. At the end, network coded cooperation in multihop networks is combined with \ac{D2D}

\subsection{Network Codes Constructions and Regimes in Cooperative D2D Cellular Networks}

Given the increase of data rates in cellular networks such as \ac{LTE-A}, we first addressed the question of when is it reasonable for a set of devices to cooperate. The underlying reason is that there has been improvements on the cellular data rates that had approached them to th order of \ac{WLAN} data rates. Thus, in paper {[\ref{paper:paperA}]}, we investigated which are the regions where cooperation with \ac{RLNC} achieves a better perfomance than broadcast with \ac{RLNC} in terms of the throughput and energy costs. From this work, we observed that codes with high field provided a reduced amount of transmissions inducing a high throughput but at the expense of including overhead due to the coding coefficients used in \ac{RLNC}. Thus, in paper {[\ref{paper:paperB}]}, we extended the analytical framework to evaluate code constructions to optimize and reduce the total overhead from redundant transmissions and coding coefficients which is a strict tradeoff with \ac{RLNC}. Later, we analyzed the possible \ac{D2D} cooperative cloud (cluster) sizes to observe the trade-off since after some point, we observed that the transmissions within the clouds will increase.

\subsection{Transmission Policies in Wireless Local Area Networks}

In order to study the transmission policies of multihop \ac{D2D} communications, we first made a software framework with the ns-3 simulator in paper {[\ref{paper:paperC}]}. The purpose of the framework was to enable network coding simulations with the Kodo library in standard open source simulators that permit to simulate aimed for the research community. Later, in paper {[\ref{paper:paperD}]} we made an extensive set of ns-3 simulations to analyze two transmission policies and a \ac{MAC} mechanism for the devices to obtain resource allocation and avoid interference in a multihop packet erasure network. Also, we investigated if ideal conditions existed for the devices to access the wireless medium.
