\section{Thesis Outline}\label{sec:intro_thesis_outline}

Based on the concepts of cooperative \ac{D2D} communications with \ac{RLNC}, this thesis covers two outlines. First, it was considered a research line which main goal is to obtain ideal codes for network coded cooperation in underlay \ac{D2D} cellular networks. Here, \ac{D2D} communications takes place within the cellular spectrum and the interference is prevented under proper network planning. Second, a research line for the device transmission policies in a decentralized local area networks.

\begin{itemize}
\item  (i) Transmit less -> Less interference, higher throughput and lower energy consumption and Telescopic Codes.
\item (ii) Kodo + ns-3
\item (iii) Recoding and decentralized MAC with ideal probability. Simulations with ns-3
\end{itemize}
