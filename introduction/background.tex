\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

\begin{itemize}
\item General introduction: Mobile networks, wireless networks, data networks. Why are they needed?
\item Specific introduction: Data multicasting, tools for simulation of networks with \ac{NC}, Multihop for data dissemination.
\item Specific problems to that should be addressed by the thesis: (i) Ideal codes for data dissemination to a large cluster of devices in a centralized manner, (ii) software tools for network coding simulations, (iii) Decentralized cooperation for spatial redudancy to enhance connectivities in multihop networks with Kodo + ns-3.
\item Introduction on network coding, RLNC and how does it help to the previous.
\end{itemize}
