Communication technologies through wireless networks generate today a large demand in high-quality data services that is only expected to grow dramatically in the following years. This future demand will saturate the networks as we know them today. Therefore, cellular network operators are interested in techniques that can offload this traffic to \ac{WLAN} such as \ac{WiFi}. In this scenario, mobile devices that have a short-range communication technology can cooperate by exploiting a much faster and reliable connectivity link to share information. Here, \ac{NC} and particularly \ac{RLNC} has proven to help and be well-suited to this scenario since it possess most of the advantages of state of the art \ac{FEC} techniques.
